Hi folks. I am Sebastian.

I love building things. Make them more useful and fun. It doesn't matter if they are small or big.

I like solving problems, because every time I can learn something new. Especially when solving the last 20%.

The answer doesn't have to be the smartest at the first shot, because I start with a simple one and iterate over it to make it better.

My mantra to build great products and services. Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
