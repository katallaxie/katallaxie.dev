You want to deploy your infrastructure with GitHub Actions?

I have published [AWS CloudFormation Action for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/aws-actions/aws-cloudformation-github-deploy) and walk you through the example of a React app in [an article on the AWS Open Source Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/deploy-aws-cloudformation-stacks-with-github-actions/).

You can also use the [Create React App Template for AWS Amplify](https://github.com/katallaxie/cra-template-amplify-typescript) to shortcut the process to connect the app to the AWS Amplify Console with AWS CloudFormation.

ðŸ‘‡

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template amplify-typescript
```

Go build!
